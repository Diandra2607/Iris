# Background
Iris is a flowering plant genus of 310 accepted species with showy flowers. It is a popular garden flower. Three iris species, which are Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor are later used as multivariate dataset. This data set is used for K-Means Clustering.

# Clustering
The first step is to checking if there are missing values in the data. Based on the first step result, there are no missing values on the data. The next step is choose sepal length and width, along with petal length and width as the variables. After that, create two scatter plots, one for sepal length and width, and another one for petal length and width. Next, determine the optimal number of cluster with Elbow method. Based on the Elbow Method, the optimal number of cluster is 3. After determine the optimal number of cluster with Elbow method, the next step is to do clustering with K-Means method. Based on K-Means Clustering analysis, the first cluster has 21 items, second cluster has 33 items, and third cluster has 96 items.

# Insight
Based on the results of the clustering analysis, the Iris dataset has been effectively partitioned into three distinct clusters. This suggests that the k-means algorithm has successfully identified groupings within the data that correspond, likely, to the three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Further analysis, comparing the cluster assignments with the actual species labels, would confirm this hypothesis.  Investigating the centroid of each cluster in the original feature space (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) would provide a characteristic profile for each cluster, essentially showing the average sepal and petal measurements for each species.  This information could be used to develop simple classification rules or for educational purposes to illustrate the morphological differences between Iris species.
Therefore, this cluster analysis has not only revealed inherent structure within the Iris dataset but has also likely rediscovered the known species classifications. This reinforces the effectiveness of k-means clustering for this type of data and provides a visual representation of the feature space that distinguishes Iris species based on sepal and petal measurements.
